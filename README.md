# wgsl-shader-generator

This is in very early stages and not yet functional.

This is a project inspired by blenders procudural shaders 

The main feature will be a bevy library that can be added to projects.
this will list models to be previewed in a basic collection like outline. with procedural shader nodes graph. allowing for easier experimentation with shaders.


There are additional end goals for this project including:
 exporting the WGSL shader to incorporate into builds.
 a macro to apply the named shader to the desired model.
